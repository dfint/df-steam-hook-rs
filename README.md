# df-steam-hook-rs

[![Build](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Re-implementation of [df-steam-hook](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook) in Rust.

Supports Windows and Linux versions of Dwarf Fortress, including [classic](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/) and [itch.io](https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress) versions.

Implemented:

- using of config/offsets files (more or less the same config format which is/was used in [df-steam-hook](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook))
- using dictionary from csv
- translation hooks
- text entry hooks (e.g. search)

## Installation

The recommended way of installation is using of the [installer](https://github.com/dfint/installer). It will install the hook, all needed configs, font, translation csv file etc.

## Manual build

### Install rustc, toolchain by using rustup

For installation of rust and cargo [see the link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

> [!NOTE]
> The use of system `rustc` and `cargo` often leads to build errors.

On Linux, after the installation use the following command:

```
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

There's no `source` command on Windows, just install `rustup`, it will add cargo to the environment variables (follow the instructions at the link at the beginning of this section).

Then install latest `nightly` toolchain using `rustup`:

```shell
rustup install nightly
```

### Build

```shell
cargo build --release
```

### Prepare the game

Copy:

- `target/release/libdfint_hook.so` to `libdfhooks.so` in the game's directory on Linux
- or `target/release/dfint_hook.dll` to `dfhooks.dll` on Windows
- [font](https://github.com/dfint/update-data/tree/main/store/fonts) to `data/art/curses_640x300.png`
- [encoding](https://github.com/dfint/update-data/tree/main/store/encodings) to `dfint-data/encoding.toml`
- [offsets](https://github.com/dfint/update-data/tree/main/store/offsets) to `dfint-data/offsets.toml`
- [dictionary](https://github.com/dfint/autobuild/tree/main/translation_build/csv/) to `dfint-data/dictionary.csv`
- [config](https://github.com/dfint/update-data/blob/main/store/config.toml) to `dfint-data/config.toml`

### Launch

Run (on Linux)

```shell
./dwarfort
```

or (on Windows)

```shell
Dwarf Fortress.exe
```

or just double click the executable file of the game (or run it from the steam client, for example).

By default, the log is written to the file: `dfint-data/dfint-log.log`
